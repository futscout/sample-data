# FutScout Event Data

## About the repo
In this repository you can find event data that exemplify the match data. The idea of this data is: 
1. to allow potential clients to check out this data and get familiar with our formats and data quality. 
2. to provide some sample data to play around with to the futsal/football analytics community! 

## About the data
- At the moment there are two games in our standard CSV format. 
- The data of these two games is anonymized, meaning there are no references to the names of players, teams or competitions. 
- For the events, in the `documentation` folder you can find a pdf file with the definition and explanation of all our events types and subtypes.

## Getting started
We provide you same python files to introduce you how to use it

## Legal stuff
- Please be responsible with the use of this data.
- If you use it for anything public, please aknowledge the source.

## Future plans
- We will try to add data for more games in the future.
- We will try to add scripts (in another repo) to get started analyzing this data.
